- takes in a boolean expression as a string
- has 3 operators: NOT, AND, OR
- returns a boolean value (true, false)
- any provided combination should be evaluated
- invalid expressions should be rejected with an error
- the expression should be evaluated with precedence:
  - NOT
  - AND
  - OR
- take parenthesis into consideration (highest precedence)
