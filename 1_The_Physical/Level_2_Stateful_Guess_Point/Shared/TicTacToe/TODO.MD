- The board has 9 squares
- X goes first, always
- Alternate between players putting X's and O's on the board
- Players can't play on a position already taken
- A player with 3 X's or O's in a row, whether it be horizontal, vertical or diagonal, wins
- If all 9 squares get filled and neither player achieves three in a row, then the game is a draw
